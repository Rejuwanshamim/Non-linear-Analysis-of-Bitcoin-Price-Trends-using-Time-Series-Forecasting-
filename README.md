# Non-linear-Analysis-of-Bitcoin-Price-Trends-using-Time-Series-Forecasting-
In this project, we focus on analyzing historical Bitcoin (BTC) price data and using time series forecasting to predict future BTC price movements. The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

*Data Exploration*: We start by loading BTC price data from a CSV file, cleaning the dataset, and gaining insights into the historical price trends.

*Visualization*: We create visualizations to better understand BTC price dynamics. These visualizations include a line plot showing BTC price over time, a histogram depicting the distribution of BTC prices, a box plot for identifying outliers, and an autocorrelation plot to assess time-dependent patterns.

*Statistical Analysis*: To gain a deeper understanding of the data, we conduct statistical analysis by calculating descriptive statistics such as mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for BTC prices.

*Time Series Forecasting*: Leveraging the AutoTS library, we employ time series forecasting techniques to predict future BTC prices. This involves training a model and generating forecasts for a specific time horizon.

The project provides valuable insights for individuals interested in Bitcoin price analysis and serves as a foundation for further research and decision-making regarding cryptocurrency investments. It showcases data visualization, statistical analysis, and time series forecasting techniques that can be applied to other financial and economic datasets.
